ðŸŽ“ Project Description
Interactive Control System Learning Tool in MATLAB is a simulation designed to teach the fundamentals of control systems through a simple physical model: a wheel rolling down an inclined plane. Built in MATLAB, the applicationâ€”named LUDICA_1â€”allows users to interactively modify the system parameters and observe how changes in the input (such as slope angle or height) affect the systemâ€™s output (wheel position).

This hands-on approach helps users understand key control system concepts:

âœ… Key Learning Features:
Real-time Parameter Tuning: Adjust the plane's inclination and height via sliders or text input and immediately see their effects on the wheelâ€™s motion.

Live Output Feedback: View position and time updates dynamically as the simulation runs.

Interactive Simulation Control: Pause, restart, or hide the wheel to experiment with various system conditions.

Clear Input/Output Mapping: Direct connection between user input (height/inclination) and system output (wheel position).

ðŸ“˜ Concepts Covered:
Plant Identification: Understand how physical properties (like slope) affect system behavior.

Stability Analysis: Explore how system behavior changes with different inclinationsâ€”unstable or stable responses.

Block Diagram Interpretation: Visualize the system using control system block diagrams that relate input and output.

Signal Flow Understanding: Learn how control signals are introduced and how they impact the plant response.

This educational tool is ideal for beginners in control systems engineering who want a visual, intuitive way to understand how inputs affect outputs in dynamic systems. It bridges theory and practice in an accessible and engaging format.
